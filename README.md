# Bike Store Application

This is a simple application for managing a bike store. It includes functionalities for managing bike products and handling customer orders. The application uses **MongoDB**, **Express**, **Node.js**, and **TypeScript** to provide a complete solution for managing products and orders in the store.

## Features

-   **Product Management:**

    -   Create, read, update, and delete bike products.
    -   Search for bikes by name, brand, or category.
    -   Display details for individual bike products.

-   **Order Management:**

    -   Place orders for bikes.
    -   Track orders based on customer email and product details.
    -   Reduce stock and manage inventory when an order is placed.
    -   Calculate total revenue from all orders.

-   **Inventory Management:**

    -   Automatically update stock levels after an order is placed.
    -   Set a product’s status to "Out of Stock" when inventory reaches zero.

-   **Revenue Calculation:**
    -   Calculate the total revenue generated from all orders using MongoDB aggregation.

## Technologies Used

-   **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
-   **Express** – Web application framework for Node.js.
-   **MongoDB** – NoSQL database used to store products and orders.
-   **Mongoose** – ODM (Object Document Mapper) for MongoDB.
-   **TypeScript** – A superset of JavaScript that adds static types.
-   **Dotenv** – A module for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
-   **CORS** – Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

## Requirements

Before running the project locally, make sure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js** – Version 16.x or higher
-   **MongoDB** – Local or cloud instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)

## Setting Up the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theMorshed/bike_store_rest_api.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install all required dependencies:

```bash
cd bike_store_rest_api
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project, and set the following environment variables:

```bash
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/bikestore(you will get this api from mongodb atlas)
```

-   **PORT:** – The port on which the server will run.
-   **DATABASE_URL:** – Your MongoDB connection URL (can be a local MongoDB instance or a MongoDB Atlas connection string).

### 4. Run the Application

Start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

This will start the server on the port specified in your .env file (default: 5000).

### 5. Access the Application

Once the server is running, you can access the application API at:

```bash
http://localhost:5000
```

## 6. API Endpoints

### Product Management:

-   **POST /api/products**: Create a new product.
-   **GET /api/products**: Get a list of all bikes. Optionally, you can query by name, brand, or category (e.g., `/api/products?searchTerm=Mountain`).
-   **GET /api/products/:productId**: Get details of a single bike.
-   **PUT /api/products/:productId**: Update bike details.
-   **DELETE /api/products/:productId**: Delete a bike.

### Order Management:

-   **POST /api/orders**: Create an order (send email, product ID, and quantity).
-   **GET /api/orders/revenue**: Calculate the total revenue generated from all orders.

## 7. Testing

You can test the endpoints using Postman or any HTTP client. Here are some example requests:

### Create Product:

-   **URL**: `POST /api/products`
-   **Body**:

```json
{
    "name": "Mountain Xtreme",
    "brand": "Giant",
    "price": 1500,
    "category": "Mountain",
    "description": "A high-performance mountain bike.",
    "quantity": 10,
    "inStock": true
}
```

### Create Order:

-   **URL**: `POST /api/orders`
-   **Body**:

```json
{
    "email": "customer@example.com",
    "product": "648a45e5f0123c45678d9012", // Replace with a valid product ID
    "quantity": 2
}
```

### Get Revenue:

-   **URL**: `GET /api/orders/revenue`
-   **Description**: This endpoint calculates the total revenue generated from all orders.
-   **Response**:

```json
{
    "message": "Revenue calculated successfully",
    "status": true,
    "data": {
        "totalRevenue": 3600 // The total revenue from all orders
    }
}
```
